This repository contains the scripts written by Dr. Machaj for analyzing the data and obtaining the results publsihed at *"Reduction of embryonic E93 expression as a key factor for the evolution of insect metamorphosis"*. 

Scripts are organized in two main analysis:

1 [RNA-seq analysis of *B. germanica* libraries under E93 knockdown compared to control](https://github.com/ylla-lab/Embryonic_E93/tree/master/RNAseq_Bger_dsE93)
	1.1 [Prepare data, QC, and mapping](RNAseq_Bger_dsE93/1_Data_download_to_mapping.md )
	1.2 [Table of counts, DEA, GSEA, etc.](https://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ylla-lab/Embryonic_E93/master/RNAseq_Bger_dsE93/2_E93_R_read_count_to_GSEA.html)
2 [Comparison of E93 expression in embryo vs pre-adult across hexapods](https://github.com/ylla-lab/Embryonic_E93/tree/master/RNAseq_multipleSpp_E93exp)
