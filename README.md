This repository contains the scripts written by Dr. Machaj for analyzing the data and obtaining the results publsihed at *"Reduction of embryonic E93 expression as a key factor for the evolution of insect metamorphosis"*. 

Scripts are organized in two main analysis:

1- [RNA-seq analysis of *B. germanica* libraries under E93 knockdown compared to control](https://github.com/ylla-lab/Embryonic_E93/tree/master/RNAseq_Bger_dsE93)

2-[Comparison of E93 expression in embryo vs pre-adult across hexapods](https://github.com/ylla-lab/Embryonic_E93/tree/master/RNAseq_multipleSpp_E93exp)
